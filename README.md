Deployed the Guestbook application(cloned from the Argo CD official repository) on EKS clusters across different environments (Dev/UAT/Prod) using Argo CD.

Each environment was set up with dedicated namespaces, leveraging Argo CD's multi-environment support for seamless deployment and management. 

This ensured environment-specific isolation and streamlined application delivery.
